                    <h2>"We Are The Champions"</h2><br>
                    <br>
                    I've paid my dues<br>
                    Time after time.<br>
                    I've done my sentence<br>
                    But committed no crime.<br>
                    <br>
                    And bad mistakesâ€’<br>
                    I've made a few.<br>
                    I've had my share of sand kicked in my face<br>
                    But I've come through.<br>
                    <br>
                    And I need to go on and on, and on, and on.<br>
                    <br>
                    We are the champions, my friends.<br>
                    And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end.<br>
                    We are the champions.<br>
                    We are the champions.<br>
                    No time for losers<br>
                    'Cause we are the champions of the world.<br>
                    <br>
                    I've taken my bows,<br>
                    And my curtain calls.<br>
                    You brought me fame and fortune, and everything that goes with it.<br>
                    I thank you all.<br>
                    <br>
                    But it's been no bed of roses,<br>
                    No pleasure cruise.<br>
                    I consider it a challenge before the whole human race,<br>
                    And I ain't gonna lose.<br>
                    <br>
                    And I need just go on and on, and on, and on.<br>
                    <br>
                    We are the champions, my friends.<br>
                    And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end.<br>
                    We are the champions.<br>
                    We are the champions.<br>
                    No time for losers<br>
                    'Cause we are the champions of the world.<br>
                    <br>
                    We are the champions, my friends,<br>
                    And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end.<br>
                    We are the champions.<br>
                    We are the champions.<br>
                    No time for losers<br>
                    'Cause we are the champions.<br>
